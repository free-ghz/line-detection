LINE-DETECTION
==============

line "detection" and generation occultics 

generating lines from lineless symbols. this means png to svg conversion. there are rules
1. no bifurcating lines - they have two ends.
2. they may cross
3. eventually, no dots - this will lead to an "effect"
4. no area. the lines are one-dimensional: length, but no width. "filled" areas must be expressed in other ways.

making cuts - lines cut by other lines (not yet)

images rendered into composites - lines in CMYK perhaps.

other things.
